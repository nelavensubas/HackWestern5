# Efficity

This is a project that was created at Hack Western 5 (Western University's annual hackathon).

Efficity allows energy providers analyze trends and everyday consumers to track their power usage easily.  
Our team decided that it's time a group of students attempt to create exposure and awareness towards energy in a fun and easy way.  With a simple adjustable potentiometer circuit to simulate power consumption, an arduino for reading  inputs, a DragonBoard 410c as the main brain, and of course only 2 hours of sleep for the hackathon, we were successful in winning two prize categories with 600 competing students!
